🚀 Just Open-Sourced: Turn Claude AI into Your Intelligent DevOps Agent

After months of experimenting with Claude for DevOps automation, I've compiled everything into a comprehensive open-source project.

Here's what you can automate with Claude:

✅ CI/CD Pipelines - Generate GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins configs in seconds
✅ Infrastructure as Code - Write & review Terraform, CloudFormation with best practices
✅ Incident Response - Analyze logs, diagnose issues, suggest fixes automatically
✅ Cloud Cost Optimization - Identify waste, get actionable savings recommendations
✅ Security Audits - Review IAM policies, security groups, compliance checks

The repo includes:
→ Complete documentation for all use cases
→ 7 working code examples you can use today
→ Python scripts with Claude API integration
→ Real-world troubleshooting patterns
→ Best practices & security guidelines

This isn't just theory. These are battle-tested patterns I've used to:
• Reduce deployment time by 60%
• Cut incident response time from hours to minutes
• Identify $3K+/month in cloud cost savings
• Automate 80% of repetitive DevOps tasks

Perfect for:
• DevOps Engineers looking to boost productivity
• Platform Teams scaling infrastructure
• SREs automating incident response
• Anyone tired of writing the same Terraform code
